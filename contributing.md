# Contributing

While I do all of the development work on Sports Bench solo, there are two ways that you can contribute to Sports Bench.

First, if you run into any issues or errors while trying to use the plugin, you can report that error by submitting a bug report through the ["Report a Problem" page](https://sportsbenchwp.com/report-a-problem/) on the website.

And second, if you have an idea for a new feature that you would like to see added to the plugin, you can submit a feature request through the ["Feature Request" page](https://sportsbenchwp.com/feature-request/) on the website.
